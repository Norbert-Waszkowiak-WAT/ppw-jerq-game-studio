# Unity Lobby

Please consult the documentation here: https://docs.unity.com/lobby/

You can also go to the [Lobby Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/lobby) to learn more, find documentation, and get support.

## SDK Documentation

The SDK is documented using XML comments. These will work with most IDEs to provide IntelliSense and inline documentation.

## Sample

Lobby comes with a simple usage sample to help you get started out of the box. Make sure you've followed the **Get Started** instructions on the [Lobby Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/lobby).

To import the Hello World usage sample:

1. Open the `Package Manager` window within Unity
2. Navigate to the `com.unity.services.lobby` and click `Import` on the **Hello World Sample**.

This will add a **Samples** folder to your project. Add the included `LobbyHelloWorld.cs` to a game object and hit *Play*.  The script will run a simplified logging demo that performs several common Lobby workflows.
